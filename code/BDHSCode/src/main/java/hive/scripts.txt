To complete this lab, you can run Hive Queries in the hive CLI (faster, but not very convenient) or the Hive-Ambari-View (slower, but more user friendly)
To open the hive CLI:
    1. open a terminal window
    2. activate the hive shell by running the `hive` command
To open the Hive-Ambari-View:
    1. open the ambari web page
    2. login as user `maria_dev` and password `maria_dev`
    3. on the top right corner click the views icon (9 dots in a square) and select the `Hive View` from the drop down
